## Dynamic 2D Grass ##
I wrote this to simulate each blade of grass individually. Each blade is made up of 3 point which together generate a Bezier curve which can be altered by changing the position of each of the 3 points. Each blade is then made up of 7 vertices to form a triangle-type shape. This was mostly to test out the idea of individually interactive grass blades that could be placed into a game.

Written in Visual Studio 2010 Express with XNA Studio 4.0. No extra libraries used. All my own code. Originally written in October 2015.
